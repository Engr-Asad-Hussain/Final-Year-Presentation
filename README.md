# Final Year Presentation
## Smart Robo Lawnmower

The usage of lawn mower has always been an essential part of grasslands. Especially, in Pakistan, gardeners are still using the cliché techniques to cut grass which includes a lot of human and is 
tedious.  

This project will reduce human effort and provide relief. Robotic lawn mowers can be used by farmers as well as by different educational institutions like universities, domestic usage in homes and in sports category used in grounds. This robot can be used in various purposes and different areas and conditions and can be further used in agricultural purposes if customized properly.  
 
In addition, this robot can be further implemented as a fully autonomous lawn mower using cameras and computer vision algorithms. 


### PROJECT PHASES
Smart Robo lawn mower is mainly divided into 2 main phases, which are: 

#### Controlling lawn mower through IoT 
Smart lawn mower is designed to reduce human effort by controlling through IoT using Blynk. Let us first go in the detail of what actually Blynk is and how does it work.

#### Controlling lawn mower through transceiver
Smart lawn mower is designed to reduce human effort by controlling through pair of transmitter and receiver also. This can be done through nrf24l01.


### PROJECT LIMITATIONS
Lawn mowers have always been a chandelier in the agricultural industries as well as for 
domestic purposes. They are actually grass cutters to cut the grass which is grown 
occasionally in the fields or in the gardens. Now a days, growing grass has become a part of 
interior decoration for schools, colleges, universities and even different offices.  
From the early 1820s lawn mowers have faced different limitations according to the era i.e. 
the conventional lawn mower requires a man power and “power” here is literal as it needs 
a powerful push to make the conventional lawn mower move on the field and cut the grass.  
In order to overcome this problem, IoT and Rf transceiver is introduced in this project but it 
too has its own limitations which are listed as follows: 
• Software reliability. 
• Reliability of electronic components. 
• Battery consumption. 
• Need of an external man power i.e. it is not autonomous. 
• Need of a wireless communication i.e. GPRS or Wi-Fi for IoT to work.  
• Rf has a certain range. 
• Heavy weight. 
• Cost (buy, support, repair and protection) of independent vehicle and additionally add 
up to cost of foundation spending to empower self-ruling vehicles and the cost sharing 
model.
